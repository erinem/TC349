    <tr><p>My sister is studying abroad in Florence, so I went to visit her for a weekend.  I was shocked at the size
      difference between Florence and Rome.  Florence was a lot smaller and had a very different look.  While I was there, we
      visited the leather market.  The leather market is something to check out!  There are people all over the place selling different
      types of leather goods.  It was very neat to see all the different products being sold!  Another thing to do in Florence is to go
      inside the Duomo.  The Duomo is a beautiful church.  While I was in there, I lit a candle for my cousin because she just had her
      first baby the day before!  I also climbed up the Duomo with my sisters.  We climbed up many, steap staircases to get to the top,
      but it was worth it! The view was amazing and you could see all of Florence!  I highly recommend climbing up.</p></tr>

    <tr><p>I happened to be in Florence one of the weekends when a little town, about an hour and a half away from Florence, was celebrating
      Carnevale.  The town is called Veriggio and it is right on the coast line.  It was a very sunny day outside when I went!  This was one
      of the best days (of my life)!  My sisters and I all bought masks and confetti to throw in the air.  The floats were amazing and full
      of detail.  Every thing was done to perfection.  Each float had a different theame and music that went along with the it.  Some floats
      even had dancers!  I had a lot of fun and it was very cool to see so many people dressed up and celebrating!  It was an amazing
      experiance and I would definately recommend going!</p></tr>

      and all the museums Florence has to offer!</p></tr>
