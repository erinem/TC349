      <h2>Signal to Noise Ratio</h2>
      <img src="img/signois1.png">
      <p>Signal to Noise Ratio Example 1 <a href="http://www.joquz.com/2004/the-tea-calendar"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as a bad example for Signal to Noise Ratio because there are two ads that jump
        out at you when you first look at the webpage.  The paragraph of small text looks like it could be
        an ad as well.  You also have to scroll down past the ad to get to the meaningful content.</p>

      <img src="img/signois2.png">
      <p>Signal to Noise Ratio Example 2 <a href="http://www.pintrest.com"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose Pintrest as a good example for Signal to Noise Ratio because there are no ads on the page.
        All of the information is relevant because it is based on the people you follow.</p>


      <h2>Chunking</h2>
      <img src="img/chunk1.png">
      <p>Chunking Example 1 <a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2007/08/28/the-critical-7-rules-to-understand-people/">
         Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as a good example for Chunking because all the information is "chunked" together with different
        colored backgrounds. This makes the site easier to read and get information and also simplifies the layout.</p>

      <img src="img/chunk2.png">
      <p>Chunking Example 2 <a href="http://www.ratedcolleges.com/blog/2009/100-amazing-how-to-sites-to-teach-yourself-anything/">
         Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as my bad example for Chunking because the site is not organized well.  This website could
        have been "chunked" into broader topics that are clickable, which lead you to more detailed options to click on.</p>


      <h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>
      <img src="img/ockham1.png">
      <p>Ockham's Razor Example 1 <a href="http://endlessfacts.com/g/10-cool-facts-about-Bill-Gates.html"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as a good example of Ockham's Razor because, even though this site is very boring, the
        design is very simple.  There are two buttons with obvious functions: one to go "home" (to learn more facts about
        different topics and people) and one to start reading "10 cool facts about Bill Gates."</p>

      <img src="img/ockham2.png">
      <p>Ockham's Razor Example 2 <a href="http://www.007museum.com/"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as a bad example of Ockham's Razor because this is not a simple design whatsoever.
        It is not organized and there are way to many, scattered links.</p>


      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <img src="img/thirds1.png">
      <p>Rule of Thirds Example 1 <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/dailysucker/"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I came across this website when I was trying to find some bad examples for this weeks exercise.  Even
         though this website is boring to look at, it is a good examle of the Rule of Thirds design.</p>

      <img src="img/thirds2.png">
      <p>Rule of Thirds Example 2 <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this website as a bad example of the Rule of Thirds design because even thought this website
        is divided into three columns, it is unpleasing to the eye.  The long lists of small texts and links
        make this website a bad example because there are no "points of interest."</p>


      <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
      <img src="img/hicks1.png">
      <p>Hick's Law Example 1 <a href="http://brandymelvilleusa.com"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose this online shop as a good example of Hick's Law because there are only 4 different links/tabs
         that the user can click on, which makes the decision options limited but useful.</p>

      <img src="img/hicks2.png">
      <p>Hick's Law Example 2 <a href="http://foodnetwork.com"> Link</a></p>
      <p>I chose the Food Network as a bad example of Hick's Law because there are a lot of options to choose from.
         Between the links at the top, the 3 images with stories that keep scrolling to new stories, and the
          stories below those leads to many different decision outcomes.</p>
