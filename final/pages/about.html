      <td><p>My name is Erin McGowan. I was born and raised in Sylvania, Ohio.  I am 22 years old and I am studying
        Media and Information at Michigan State University.  Last semester, I am studied in Rome,
        Italy at John Cabot University.  JCU is a small American university located in Trastevere along the Tiber River.  About 1,000
        students from over 60 countries attend John Cabot.  The campus is made up of two buildings, about a 10 minute walk from each
        other.  I decided to make my website about my travels around Italy and Europe, not only because I miss it, but also because
        there are many times when it can be stressful.  Since I am a simple person, I decided to go with the simple layout so the
        users can get right to the information!  I want to be able to give other people tips on where and how to travel and
        to suggest places to go and things to see!</p></td>
