    <tr><p>I have never been to Ireland before and I was lucky enough to be able to go over St. Patrick's Day!  Being from an
      Irish background made my trip even better!  My family came along for the holiday as well.  We spent the first few days
      there site seeing and taking in the culture.  We went to see Trinity College.  Such a beautiful campus that was filled with
      tourists and students.  I would suggest going to the campus and walking around.  If there is time, go into the library.
      The Trinity College library is a beautiful, old library and inside, you get to see the Book of Kells!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>One of my favorite activities we did in Dublin was the tour of the Guinness Storehouse.  *Tip: If you buy your tickets
      online, you get to skip the line!  My family and I got right in.  The Storehouse was filled with the history and the details of
      making the perfect Guinness.  You get to learn about the history of the trial and error of perfecting the Guinness.  The
      Storehouse had seven floors, each filled with something new.  There were bars on almost every floor, a taste testing room,
      and a station where you could earn a certificate once you learned how to pour the perfect Guinness!</p></tr>

      the bar for a beautiful sunset.</p></tr>

    <tr><p>One night, we went to a resturant called McGowan's.  Having McGowan as our last name, we had to check it out!  It had
      a great atmosphere and was filled with even better food.  Around 11 at night, the nightlife crowd started to come in.
      The DJ started playing and people started dancing.  It was a lot of fun to get up and dance or just watch all the people
      dance and mingle around.  I would recommend going there!  Another place that is a must see is the famous Temple Bar.  This
      place was crawling with people!  It was a blast!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>St Patrick's Day was a blast!  Being our first time in Ireland for St. Patrick's Day, we did not know that they trated
      it like a national holiday.  So, alcohol was not served until 12:30!  Luckily, my dad found a place that was braking the rules.
      It was probably the busiest pub in Dublin until 12:30!  After a few drinks, we went to get some shepherds pie - a must have!
      We then went to watch the parade.  The streets were filled with people all dressed up in green!  People were watching from belconies,
      rooftops, and windows.  It was amazing how many people were out and dressed in green!</p></tr>
