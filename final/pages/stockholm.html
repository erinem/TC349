      freezing weather, Stockholm was such a beautiful city, filled with amazing buildings!  I could not stop taking pictures
      of all the sites!  Stockholm is made up of several small islands, all connected by bridges.</p></tr>

    <tr><p>While in Stockholm, we visited the Fotografiska museum.  It is a museum filled with many famous photographs.  It was a
      very interesting museum and on the top floor, there is a cafe where you can get food and drinks while looking out at an
      amazing view of Stockholm.  Another museum  worth going to is the Vasa Museum.  In here, you can look at a large ship from 1628.
      The ship was underwater for around 300 years and is still perfectly preserved.  I love history, so it was very interesting to
      see how this large ship was lost underwater for many years and was still preserved!  It is the only ship from the 17th century
      that is still preserved in the whole world!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>While visiting Stockholm, we stayed in a boat hostel.  There was a deck with tables and chairs where people could sit.
      All the rooms were underneith the boat and each room and circular windows.  It was something very different to stay in and
      a fun experiance!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>Walking around finding some place to eat was a lot of fun.  All the people were very nice and there was a lot to look at
      while walking around!  One of the things that was very different about Stockholm was the currency.  The average price of a drink
      or food was 250 to 400 kronor.  It was very hard to figure out and understand, so I downloaded an app that converted the price
      for me!  It was very helpful, especially when we got our first receipt!</p></tr>

      cinnamon roll!  Sundbergs Konditori is a small but cute cafe with good sandwiches and unlimited coffee!</p></tr>
