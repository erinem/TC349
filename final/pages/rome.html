    <tr><p>John Cabot and my appartment where I lived was located in Trastevere.  Trastevere is
      located right outside of Rome.  It is an old town filled with so much life and character.
      It's narrow streets are filled with cobblestones.  It's buildings are old and colorful
      making the area "homey."  During the day, Trastevere is mostly filled with students walking to class,
      locals grabbing lunch, and cars trying to squeeze their way past all the people.  At night, more
      bars and places to grab a bite to eat open up.  People flood into the streets talking, laughing,
      and drinking.  Trastevere is like nothing you have ever seen before!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>Rome; my home away from home for the semester!  I had been lucky enough to be able to study abroad in Rome.  I
      loved every thing about that city.  I have spent a lot of time site seeing and enjoying the culture.  I really loved the
      different looks and feels of the buildings.  I loved all the history of Rome.  All the layers of history truely amazed me.
      I found it so interesting that buildings and monuments built in the 18th century were considered "modern" there, while back in
      the states, the 18th century is very old!</p></tr>
