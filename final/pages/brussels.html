    <tr><p>I went to Brussels for the weekend with my friends.  Brussels is a small city with a very laid-back vibe.
      It is made up of many different, cool buildings.  It does not take a long time to see everything in the city and there
      is not a lot to do there.  Whenever we would ask the locals what to do, they would always respond with the same answer:
      "Eat, drink, and get laid!"  It even said this on a tourist map!  The city of Brussels is made up of two different looks.  One
      part was more moders and had a "Chicago-type" feel to is.  The other part of the city was made up of buildings where every other
      building looked different.  I would suggest spending time walking around the city and taking in its uniqueness.  Aside from the
      look of Brussels, the food was amazing! I had the best waffles and fries I have ever had in my entire life!  One place I suggest
      going is a little stop called Vitalgaufre.  They have the best waffles I have ever had!</p></tr>

    <tr><p>One place that should be on ever sight seeing list is the Grand Palace during the day and the night.  It is a beautiful building during the day and at night!   Another place that is worth seeing is the Atomium. The Atomium was originally constructed for the 1958
      World Fair in Brussels.  It is in the shape of a cell from an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times.  It is located a little outside of the
      city, but the view is amazing from the top of the Atomium.</p></tr>

    <tr><p>Most of what Brussels has to offer can be seen in a day or two.  If there is time to spare, I would suggest taking a day
      trip to Brugge.  Brugge is only a train ride away!  It is one of my newly favorite cities! There is no way to describe it except that it felt
      like a "fairy tale town."  The buildings are even more different than they were in Brussels.  A "must stop" place in Brugge is called The
      Chocolate Line.  This is a small store with more options of chocolate flavors than you could even imagine!  They have every thing from milk
      chocolate to chocolate with roasted tomatoes in it!</p></tr>
